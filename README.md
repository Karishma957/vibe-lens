# 📱 Vibe Lens – A Touch-Based Assistant for Deaf-Blind Users

Vibe Lens is an inclusive Flutter app designed to empower individuals who are both **deaf and blind** by converting essential information into **Morse-code vibrations** triggered by simple **gestures**. It requires no visual or auditory input—just **touch**.

> 🧭 Aiming to redefine accessibility through haptic feedback, Vibe Lens serves as a **vibrating communicator** for time, weather, battery, and emergencies.
